CODING STYLE
============

 - Please follow the coding style already used (which is close to the
   GNU style) - if adding new files please include the following mode
   line for emacs and other editors:

   -*- mode: C; c-file-style: "gnu"; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-

 - Spaces, not tabs, are used.

 - All external interfaces (network protocols, file formats, etc.)
   should be documented in man pages or other documentation.


SOURCE CONTROL
==============

Anonymous checkouts:

  $ git clone git://git.freedesktop.org/git/DeviceKit/DeviceKit-disks.git

Checkouts for ssh account holders

  $ git clone ssh://[username@]git.freedesktop.org/git/DeviceKit/DeviceKit-disks.git

COMMITTING CODE
===============

 - Commit messages should be of the form (the five lines between the
   lines starting with ===)

=== begin example commit ===
Short explanation of the commit

Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
=== end example commit ===

 - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
   the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
   second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).

 - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
   must start with a capital letter. Don't use a trailing period.

 - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
   punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
   sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.

 - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
   git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>"

 - If submitting (or commiting) patch in Bugzilla prefix the first
   line with "Bug <Number> — <Bug Title>" (the dash is U+2014 EM DASH,
   not '-') and include the bug URL in the commit message. Example:
   "Bug 24885 — LVM LVs now have NOPOLICY=0" and
   http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24885.
