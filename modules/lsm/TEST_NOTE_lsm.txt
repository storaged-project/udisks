## NetApp ONTAP iSCSI Test

 * New LUN attached after udisksd (with module loaded) started.
   `iscsiadm -m session -R`

 * Exiting LUN removed from storage array. LSM dbus interface should be purged.
    * iSCSI
        * Got change uevent(size to 0) on next I/O, but /dev/sdX and sysfs
          entries still exist.

 * Delete certain disk via sysfs and scan it back:
    echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/block/sdX/device/delete
        # This is the a simulation of FC/FCoE dev_lose_tmo.
    find /sys/class/scsi_host/*/scan -exec echo {} \;  \
        -exec sudo bash -c "echo '- - -' > {}" \;

 * Degrade the RAID to check dbus signal.
    netapp shell:
        disk simpull v5.32
    linux dbus monitor:
        dbus-monitor --system
