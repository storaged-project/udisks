        Noted: even from user's view, RAID degrade does not cause any
        error or warning at OS level, the 'isOK' property will still be set
        as 'FALSE' to suggest user to do more checking on what's going on.

        Whether this drive is degraded RAID, for example, one disk failure

        Whether this drive is facing RAID error, for example, two disks

         A string of backend RAID type of this disk drive.

            Disk enclosure 1 slot 9(serial: CVDA452606ME1207GN) is offline.

        The minimum I/O size, device preferred I/O size for random I/O.
        Any I/O size not equal to a multiple of this value may get
        significant speed penalty. Normally it refers to strip size of
        each RAID disk(extent). If LibStorageMgmt failed to detect min_io_size,
