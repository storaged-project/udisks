GENERAL RULES
=============

You're welcome to use LLM (Large Language Model) coding assistants for
contributions as long as:

 - you understand the code

 - you automatically assume you're the author bearing all responsibilities

 - you're able to answer questions during and post review

 - you're sure that the code constructions are not covered by patents or
   licensed under an incompatible license to UDisks

 - the contribution clearly states the help of an LLM (e.g. use a commit message
   tag `Assisted-by:`, `Generated-By:` or `Co-Authored-By:`)


CODING STYLE
============

 - Please follow the coding style already used (which is close to the
   GNU style) - if adding new files please include the following mode
   line for emacs and other editors:

   -*- mode: C; c-file-style: "gnu"; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-

 - Spaces, not tabs, are used.

 - All external interfaces (network protocols, file formats, etc.)
   should be documented in man pages or other documentation.


SOURCE CONTROL
==============

Anonymous checkouts:

  $ git clone git@github.com:storaged-project/udisks.git

Follow the usual GitHub 'Creating a pull request from a fork' guidelines:
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork


COMMITTING CODE
===============

 - Commit messages should be of the form (the five lines between the
   lines starting with ===)

=== begin example commit ===
Short explanation of the commit

Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
=== end example commit ===

 - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
   the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
   second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).

 - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
   must start with a capital letter. Don't use a trailing period.

 - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
   punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
   sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.

 - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
   git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>"
